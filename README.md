# Zero-Cool-Pepper-Co
Hello, the purpose of this README.md file is to document the requirements met for Code Louisville's front-end development capstone project as coded by me. I have written a website that shows my interest in both growing & cooking with hot peppers. 

The next section shows the featured requirements chosen from the syllabus in this capstone site project.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feature Requirements:
Choose a minimum of 3 of the below features and incorporate into your site
•	Use flexbox to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes
- multiple  areas using flexbox
 
•	Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout
- media queries added to handle both mobile & tablet layouts.


•	Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com forma

•	Create a JavaScript function whose return value is used in your site. The function must be triggered by user action (ex: clicking a button).
 - I have a contact form which calls a javascript function verifying the form cannot be submitted unless a name is provided.


•	Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through
 - i have added an image carousel under the Peppers section just beneath "Sugar Rush Peach" peppers.

Additional Requirements:
ALL of the below requirements must be met.

•	Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way
  o	We will look at your app on a desktop screen and a mobile device to see what changes occur
  o	We must be able to see the change that your code is making on your website – a media query can be written correctly but have no actual effect. That will not be ok in this class.
  
•	Your project includes at minimum 3 custom-written CSS elements (selectors, classes, etc) located in a .css file which are applied to your HTML elements
  o	The CSS must be included in its own file, not “in-line” on your HTML page – we want to see that you can properly “link” a stylesheet
  o	Many of the options in the first requirement will also fulfil this requirement
  
•	Your project includes JavaScript in a separate .js file
  o	Script tags in your HTML file must execute the JS file
  o	Many of the options in the first requirement will also fulfil this requirement
  
•	Your code have comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read
  o	You don’t need to go crazy on this - a few code comments are perfectly fine
  
•	Your project code is uploaded to your GitHub account, in its own repository, with at least5 commits
  o	We need to see that you’ve used Git to update your GitHub profile at least 5times
  o	Using GitHub’s file uploader does not count as a check-in. You must upload via Git.
  
•	It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes:
  o	A description of your project
  o	What features you chose to include (so we know what to look for)
  o	Any special instructions we might need to run your project
